Walker is an iconic figure in Black history for her groundbreaking achievements as an entrepreneur, philanthropist, and social activist. She is considered America's first self-made female millionaire, and her impact extends far beyond her business success.

Madam C.J. Walker built an empire around hair care products for Black women. She created a line of beauty and hair products specifically designed to address the unique needs of African American women’s hair, making her an innovator in the beauty industry. Her brand, Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company, was hugely successful and became one of the first Black-owned businesses to reach national recognition.

Walker's success was a testament to the power of self-reliance and economic independence. She hired and trained thousands of Black women as sales agents, offering them a path to financial independence and promoting entrepreneurship within the Black community.

Walker used her wealth to support causes such as education, racial equality, and women’s rights. She was a generous philanthropist, donating to Black churches, schools, and organizations like the NAACP. She was also vocal in her support for the civil rights movement and advocated for the rights of Black women.

Madam C.J. Walker remains a symbol of resilience and determination. Her success story continues to inspire generations of entrepreneurs, particularly women and people of color, proving that with innovation, hard work, and vision, it’s possible to overcome obstacles and build a lasting legacy.

Madam C.J. Walker's contributions to both the beauty industry and the empowerment of Black people, particularly women, make her a key figure in Black history.",0,"02/24/2025 07:00",https://www.instagram.com/p/DGdbbNjoxsi/,"IG image",,Lifetime,49,36,2,0,0,0,

His work focuses on criminal justice reform, racial justice, and fighting mass incarceration, particularly advocating for wrongfully convicted individuals and juveniles sentenced to life without parole.

His impact is monumental because:

He has successfully argued multiple cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, leading to landmark decisions on juvenile sentencing. His book, Just Mercy, was adapted into a major film, raising awareness about the injustices in the legal system. He spearheaded the creation of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, the first memorial in the U.S. dedicated to victims of racial terror and lynching. Stevenson is shaping history by challenging systemic racism and working towards a more just and equitable society.

He is a world-renowned visual artist known for his vibrant, large-scale portraits that reimagine classical European-style paintings with Black subjects.

Why He’s Important:

Historic Presidential Portrait: He made history in 2018 as the first Black artist to paint an official presidential portrait for the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery with his stunning depiction of President Barack Obama.

Reclaiming Representation: His work challenges the absence of Black figures in traditional Western art by placing them in regal, powerful, and dignified positions.

Public Art & Global Impact: His “Rumors of War” statue, unveiled in 2019, reinterprets Confederate monuments by featuring a young Black man in modern clothing on a powerful horse, symbolizing resilience and strength.

Through his art, Wiley is reshaping historical narratives and ensuring that Black representation in fine art is celebrated and honored.",0,"02/06/2025 04:00",https://www.instagram.com/p/DFuwcddqIOs/,"IG image",,Lifetime,113,86,7,0,0,0,
